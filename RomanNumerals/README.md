## The Basics

To get the karma runner started:

```
npm install
grunt karma
```

## Instructions

This repo contains test setup and the code for the first case. Your job is to implement the remaining cases. Remember to always start with a failing test: red-green-refactor-repeat.

1. I should return 1
2. V should return 5
3. X should return 10
4. II should return 2
5. III should return 3
6. VI should return 6
7. IV should return 4
8. VII should return 7

That should cover the basic of roman numerals. Two bonus cases:

- LXIII should return 63
- XCV should return 95
